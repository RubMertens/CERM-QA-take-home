# Cerm QA takehome

The goal of this assignment is to write automated tests for a todo application which can be found on [docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/rubmertens/todo-cerm-qa-takehome).

The application can be run using the docker commmand `docker run -p 8080:8080 rubmertens/todo-cerm-qa-takehome:0.0.1`

The tests can be run using `dotnet test` run inside the Carm.QA.Takehome folder in the repository.


Good luck!
